   <h1 class=normal>An Introduction</h1>
   <p class=large>
      Hi there, I'm Cuno Nasserie, a student at the Vrije Universiteit van Amsterdam.
      I'm positive, lively and some call me a free spirit. I haven't always been like
      that. But through hard work, patience and experience, I got to where I am now.
      I do what brings me joy, creating things and helping people. I have been programming
      for several years now and recently started 3D-modelling. The joy of making something
      and being able to see/hold/use it is what drives me forward. Feel free to follow my
      projects on the Projects page, or the Game Maker and Blender pages.
   </p>

   <h1 class=normal>My Passion</h1>
   <p class = normal>
      I'm very passionate about creating things, I always have a bunch of projects to
      work on. While I find it difficult to do the final touches, the joy of finishing
      something is always worth it. I'll still be looking for new ways to create things.
      Drawing, coding, 3D-modelling, writing, cooking, It is great to be able to express
      yourself in a way that you can apreciate it later on.
   </p>
   <h2 class=normal>Coding</h1>
   <p class=normal>
      I started coding a long time ago. I spend most of my hours on Game Maker 2. And
      after that Game Maker Studio. But I have also glanced over some other programming
      languages besides GML. I have done little projects in Batch, Bash, Python, Javascript,
      lua, vbs, sql, R, c++, php, html & css (lol), and I'm probably forgetting some others
      that I have coded in. One language that deserves a bit more attention is Java. 
   </p>
   <p class=normal>
      I did <a href='https://github.com/cunothe1/Java'>a java project </a> for my final project 
      on highschool. Then later on university, we had to code in Java. I was weeks ahead of the
      rest, and I got a lot of joy when I surprised my Teaching Assistant with extra features and
      improvements that weren't even needed for our assignments. I aided others as well and had
      a lot of fun while doing that. Java is a programming language that I still use, besides GML.
   </p>
   <p>
      The thing that I like most about coding, isn't necesarily making the core program. I love 
      to make bots. Improving them beyond human abilities, and than artificially limiting them
      so that my colleagues can still enjoy the game. It often requires you to do more advanced
      calculations. I once spend 4 hours, working on a fully variable ellipsical distance formula.
      When I showed my math teacher what I was doing, he was very impressed, and doubted its
      practical use. Doing hard calculations, making bots, custom generators and things like that
      is what I enjoy the most.
   </p>
   <h2 class=normal>3D modelling</h1>
   <p>
      I'm relatively new to the modelling game. I started blender in 2019 and did a few marathons
      where I would upload every day. After a while I had to work a lot more and didn't have the 
      time to make new models. But I dug it out of the closet again and I'm currently doing a large
      Architecture project. I'm also thinking of starting a 2-renders every week challange.
