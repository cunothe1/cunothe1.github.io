  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>
    Hello there! Welcome to my site. Here you can find out a bit more about me and what I do. This site will be the centre of my passion project. Here I’ll post blender renders, programs and other things that I enjoy! My goal is to share my creations and to keep busy with doing that what I love, coding, 3d-modelling and a bit of traveling. Not everything will be great here. The site could use some upgrades, but there is a reason. I want this site to be mine, and not some creation by wix, squarespace or any other website builders. I’m the builder here and I welcome you to my workplace!

    <p class='subtitle'>
      I'm always busy with so many projects. Here is an overview of what I'm currently spending my time on. 
    </p>

  <div class="whitediv left">
    <h2>University</h2>
    <h3>Web Technology</h3>
    <p>
      In Web Technology we learn the key ideas, languages and protocols underlying the web. Including separation of concerns, front and back end web development and web-languages as HTML, CSS, JavaScript. In the practical sessions we're making our own dummy phone webshop to introduce us to many aspects of web-development. Although I do have my own experience with web-development, it is still nice to see the structural way of working on websites.

    <h2>Guitar</h2>
    <p>
      Music is one of my favourite ways to express myself. However, guitar is so beautiful that it would be a waste to only play originals. So I'm learning scores that I like from the youtube channel <i>"Sky guitar"</i>. They post really good tutorials with tablature that is really detailed and totally not like the basic tablature you often find on guitar tabs. They do a real good job at keeping the soul of the pieces without throwing new players against a difficulty wall.

    <p>
      3D design is so satisfying. Sadly, it's quite hard. So I have decided to make a blender object every week to develop my skills and work-flow. Sometimes I miss out on a week, but I try not to.

    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>
      I'm programming a card-game when I have the time for it. I'm doing it in code to make it easier to work on game-balancing. Eventually I will have to design the actual cards and the artwork for it, which will be fun, but a lot of work. When it is done, then I already have a professional contact who can print the rule-booklet and the cards for me.

    Finally working on this mess again! The site was made in 2017 or something. I used it as file storage/sharing, but now it has a purpose again! I only need to clean of the dust and rebuild it to its former glory!
